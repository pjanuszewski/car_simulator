# Car Simulation with C++

## Overview

This C++ program simulates a basic car using a multi-threaded approach for simulation and user input. The car's kinematics, including position, speed, acceleration, RPM, and gear, are displayed in real-time in an output file. User inputs, such as pressing gas or brake pedals, changing gears, and quitting the simulation, are accepted during runtime.

## How to Use

1. **Turn on the Engine:**
   - Start the program and turn on the engine by pressing 'e'.

2. **Simulation Controls:**
   - Press 'q' to quit the simulation.
   - Press 'g' to simulate pressing the gas pedal.
   - Press 'b' to simulate pressing the brake pedal.
   - Press 'rg' to simulate releasing the gas pedal.
   - Press 'rb' to simulate releasing the brake pedal.
   - Press '1', '2', '3', '4', or '5' to set the gear to the corresponding value.

3. **Simulation Results** \
View the results of the simulation in the `output.log` file. This file contains detailed information about the car's position, speed, acceleration, RPM, and gear at each time step of the simulation.

 **Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have a C++17 (or later) compiler installed.
